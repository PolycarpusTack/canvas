# Canvas - Local Visual Web Editor

A lightweight, local-first visual editor for web projects. No lock-in, no cloud, just clean code editing with a visual interface.

## 🎯 MVP Focus

Building ONLY what's in the mockup:
- Visual editing of HTML/CSS
- Drag & drop components
- Property editing
- Save/load projects
- Export clean code

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install Python 3.8+
# Then:
cd /mnt/c/Projects/canvas
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── src/           # Application source
├── templates/     # Starter templates
├── assets/        # Icons and resources
└── docs/          # Documentation
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python** - You already know it
