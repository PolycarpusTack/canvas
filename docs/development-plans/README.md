3. **Export Memory Usage**: Stream processing for large projects
4. **Rich Text Complexity**: Start with basic features, iterate

### Mitigation Approaches
- Prototype high-risk features first
- Implement performance monitoring early
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Plan for technical debt sprints

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 3s
- 60fps during all interactions
- Memory usage < 500MB
- 0 critical security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- Feature completion rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Adoption metrics
- Support ticket reduction

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Canvas Editor README** for project overview
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** for coding guidelines
3. **Choose a development plan** based on priorities
4. **Set up development environment** per main README
5. **Start with Phase 1 analysis** of chosen plan
6. **Implement following TDD** approach
7. **Submit PRs** referencing plan sections

Each development plan is self-contained and provides everything needed to implement that functionality independently while maintaining consistency with the overall architecture.
