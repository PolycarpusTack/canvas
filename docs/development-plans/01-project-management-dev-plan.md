# Project Management - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Solution Design Analysis & Validation

### 1. Initial Understanding
- **Goal**: Implement comprehensive project management system for Canvas Editor
- **Stack**: Python/Flet, SQLite/JSON storage, watchdog for file monitoring
- **Components**: ProjectManager, FileWatcher, StateManager integration
- **User Personas**: Developers creating web projects

### 2. Clarity Assessment
- **ProjectManager**: High (3) - Well-defined interfaces and data models
- **File Operations**: High (3) - Clear requirements and patterns
- **Auto-save**: Medium (2) - Timing and conflict resolution need clarification
- **Overall Clarity**: High (3)

### 3. Technical Feasibility
- **File System Operations**: Low risk (1) - Standard Python pathlib
- **Auto-save**: Medium risk (2) - Need debouncing and conflict handling
- **Large Projects**: Medium risk (2) - Performance with 1000+ files

### 4. Security Assessment
- **Path Traversal**: Validate all file paths
- **File Permissions**: Check before operations
- **Sensitive Data**: No secrets in project metadata

### 5. Compliance
- **Data Privacy**: Project files stay local
- **Audit Trail**: Log all project operations

**Recommendation**: PROCEEDING with backlog generation

## EPIC A: Core Project Management

Implement fundamental project creation, import, save, and load functionality with robust error handling.

**Definition of Done:**
- ✓ All project operations work reliably
- ✓ 90%+ test coverage achieved
- ✓ Performance benchmarks met (< 3s for 1000 files)

**Business Value:** Foundation for all Canvas Editor functionality

**Risk Assessment:** 
- File system errors (Medium/2) - Mitigate with comprehensive error handling
- Performance with large projects (Medium/2) - Implement pagination and lazy loading

**Cross-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance: < 3s operation time for projects with 1000 files
- Security: Path validation, permission checks
- Observability: Structured logging for all operations

When I submit the form
Then I see a validation error
And no project is created
