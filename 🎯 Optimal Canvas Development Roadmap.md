🎯 Optimal Canvas Development Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

1. State Management (Week 1-2) - CRITICAL FIRST

Why Absolutely First:

- ✅ Zero dependencies - Can start immediately
- ✅ Universal requirement - ALL modules need state management
- ✅ Complex architecture - Needs early validation for performance
- ✅ Redux-like patterns - Establishes data flow for entire app

2. Project Management (Week 2-3) - ✅ DONE

Why Second:

- ✅ Builds on state - Requires state management for project data
- ✅ Foundation for all - Every feature needs project context
- ✅ Early user value - Enables basic project creation

---

Phase 2: Core Components (Weeks 3-7) - PARALLEL TRACKS

3A. Component Library (Week 3-4) - PARALLEL TRACK A

Why Third (Parallel):

- 🔄 Only needs state - Can start once state management done
- 🧱 Building blocks - Required for all UI interactions
- 👥 Team A can focus - Independent from property editor

3B. Property Editor (Week 3-5) - PARALLEL TRACK B

Why Third (Parallel):

- 🔄 Only needs state - Independent development possible
- 🎛️ UI foundation - Component editing interface
- 👥 Team B can focus - Different skillset from component library

4. Canvas Rendering (Week 5-6)

Why Fourth:

- 📋 Needs Component Library - Component definitions for rendering
- 🎛️ Needs Property Editor - Properties drive visual styles
- 🎨 Visual foundation - Required before drag/drop interactions
- ⚡ Performance critical - Complex rendering pipeline

---

Phase 3: Advanced Interactions (Weeks 6-9)

5. Drag & Drop System (Week 7-8)

Why Fifth:

- 🎨 Needs Canvas Rendering - Visual feedback and drop targets
- 🧱 Needs Component Library - Constraint validation
- 🎛️ Needs Property Editor - Component creation workflow
- 🎯 Core UX - Primary interaction model

6. Rich Text Editor (Week 8-9) - INDEPENDENT

Why Sixth (Can be parallel):

- 📝 Specialized module - Different team can work on it
- 🔄 Minimal dependencies - Only needs state + basic properties
- 🚀 Can start earlier - If team capacity allows

---

Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 9-12)

7. Export System (Week 10-12) - MUST BE LAST

Why Last:

- 🌐 Depends on EVERYTHING - Needs complete system integration
- 🔧 Validation tool - Tests that all systems work together
- 📦 Production output - Converts editor to deployable code

---

🚀 Parallel Development Strategy

Weeks 3-4: Dual Track

Team A: Component Library
Team B: Property Editor
Integration: Both use state management

Weeks 8-9: Independent Tracks

Team A: Drag & Drop System
Team B: Rich Text Editor
Minimal: Cross-dependencies

⚡ Critical Path Dependencies

State Management
↓
Project Management (✅ DONE)
↓
Component Library + Property Editor (PARALLEL)
↓
Canvas Rendering
↓
Drag & Drop System
↓
Export System

Rich Text Editor (INDEPENDENT - can run parallel)

🎯 Why This Order is Perfect

Respects Dependencies

- State Management enables everything else
- Component Library + Property Editor can be parallel
- Canvas Rendering needs both for proper rendering
- Drag & Drop needs visual feedback from Canvas
- Export needs complete system integration

Maximizes Parallel Work

- 2 major parallel development opportunities
- Different skill sets can work simultaneously
- Reduces overall timeline by 2-3 weeks

Minimizes Risk

- Complex modules (State, Canvas) tackled early
- Integration points validated at each phase
- Export last validates entire system works

Enables Early Validation

- Foundation modules tested thoroughly first
- Visual progress visible after Phase 2
- User interactions working after Phase 3

📅 Realistic Timeline

With 4-6 developers:

- Phase 1: 3.5 weeks (Foundation)
- Phase 2: 3.5 weeks (Core, parallel development)
- Phase 3: 2.5 weeks (Interactions)
- Phase 4: 2.5 weeks (Export)
- Total: 12 weeks

🎯 Next Steps for You

Since Project Management is done:

1. Start State Management (06-state-management-dev-plan.md) - CRITICAL NEXT
2. Plan Component Library (07-component-library-dev-plan.md) - Parallel track
3. Plan Property Editor (03-property-editor-dev-plan.md) - Parallel track

Recommended: Focus on State Management next since it's the critical blocker for everything else. Once that's 50%
done, you can start parallel development on Component Library and Property Editor.

This order will give you the fastest path to a working Canvas Editor while maintaining high code quality and
avoiding major refactoring later.
