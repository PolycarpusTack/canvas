- **Build tool detection**: Webpack, Rollup, Vite
- **Fallback detection** using file extensions and structure

#### ✅ Optimized File Scanning (A-2-T2)
- **Batch processing** for large directories (100 files per batch)
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** for parallel I/O operations
- **Smart ignore patterns** (node_modules, .git, dist, etc.)
- **File size limits** to prevent memory issues
- **Performance monitoring** with timing logs
- **Configurable limits** respecting MAX_PROJECT_FILES

#### ✅ Robust Auto-Save System (B-1-T1)
- **Debounced operations** preventing excessive saves

- **Atomic file writes** using temporary files
- **Failure recovery** with detailed error logging

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_project_management.py`)

#### ✅ Unit Tests (CLAUDE.md #6.2 FIRST Principles)
- **Fast**: Use in-memory filesystem and mocks
- **Independent**: Each test is isolated with fixtures
- **Repeatable**: Consistent results across runs
- **Self-validating**: Clear pass/fail assertions
- **Timely**: Written alongside implementation

#### ✅ Test Coverage Areas
- **Model validation** testing all validation rules
- **Security features** testing path traversal, XSS protection
- **Error handling** testing all exception paths
- **Performance** testing file scanning limits
- **Integration** testing complete workflows
- **Auto-save** testing debouncing and retry logic

#### ✅ Security Test Cases
- Path traversal attacks
- XSS injection attempts
- Reserved name usage
- Invalid character handling
- HTML content sanitization
- File content safety checks
